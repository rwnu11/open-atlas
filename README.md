# open-atlas
open atlas is my attempt at an open source terrain generator


I haven't seen many open source terrain generators. This is my implementation of that.

1. Get a 2D heightmap viewer using SDL and imgui. Get OpenGL working so we can later do 3D view
2. add terrain generation techniques
3. ...
